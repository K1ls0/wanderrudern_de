# Decin - Meißen 3. Advent 08


The RC KST Advent Rowing trip from Decin, Czech Republic to Meissen, Germany took place December 12-14, 2008. The weather was brisk and chilly, and the waters of the Elbe River were below average for the time of year, but the warm spirits and high energy of the rowers made the trip a delightful experience. Approximately 20 club members participated in the trip; young and old alike. The group travelled by bus to Decin on Friday evening where we dined on typical Czech cuisine. On Saturday morning we built the “Barke”, (somewhat of a “brain gym” activity) by connecting two of our four-man boats with a platform, allowing the rowers to easily change positions on the boat and to enjoy the hot seasonal drinks that were continuously steaming on the aft deck. In all, there were four boats on the trip. Throughout the day we viewed many beautiful and historical sites along the banks of the river. Arriving at Pirna we spent the night in the        rowing club, after strolling through the local Christmas market and dining in a traditional local restaurant. On Sunday we rowed through the beautiful city of Dresden, and arrived in Meissen in the late afternoon. After disassembling the boats and loading them on the trailer, we returned to Kleinmachnow by car, blissfully exhausted!
